In seeing this, the first thing I notice is the single characters inside of the quotations. This means that "L" must correspond to either "I" or "A". This would automatically mean that the Caesar shift key is either 3 backwards or 11 backwards. When translating the given cipher such that the "L" would become an "A", or a backwards 11 shift, it starts as "A OAKZ AL FWWV FGL", which is unintelligible. This means that the required shift is a backwards 3, meaning that the first letter of the first quotation is "I". The -3 shift results in the following:
